/**
* Note that many of programming best practices are violated within
* this class; for instance we use a lot of switch statements rather
* than polymorphism.  This is necessitated by the inflexibility of the
* Message format provided by battlecode, and the necessity to encode
* a variety of different messages and information within a single
* Message, itself containing an array of ints, Strings, and MapLocations.
* We therefore must use a variety of tricks to encode all the various information
* that we need to transfer; for instance the map information can be encoded as
* two 2-dimensional arrays of booleans, which we store within a single String object.
